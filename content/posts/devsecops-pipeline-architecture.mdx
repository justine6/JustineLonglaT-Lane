# Building a DevSecOps Pipeline Architecture

## Core Stages
1. **Source**: signed commits, branch protections.
2. **Build**: SBOM, SAST.
3. **Test**: unit/integration, IaC checks, secrets scan.
4. **Deploy**: canary, runtime policy, drift detection.

> Outcome: repeatable releases with traceable evidence for audits.
