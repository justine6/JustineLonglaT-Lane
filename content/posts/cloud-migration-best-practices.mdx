# Cloud Migration Best Practices

A pragmatic checklist to reduce risk and keep velocity high during cloud migration.

## 1) Discovery & Baseline
- Inventory apps, data, dependencies, and SLAs.
- Map compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI, SOX).

## 2) Landing Zone & Guardrails
- Organizations, SCPs, IAM, SSO, baseline networking (VPCs, subnets).
- Centralized logging, security services, and cost controls.

## 3) Migration Strategy
- Rehost vs. replatform vs. refactor; choose per workload based on ROI.

## 4) Validate
- Blue/green cutovers, synthetic tests, and rollback criteria.

> Tip: Automate everything you can measure—then measure everything you automate.
