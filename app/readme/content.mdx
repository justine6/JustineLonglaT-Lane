# Technical README

Welcome! This page mirrors the repo README so stakeholders can learn about the project **without** code access.

## What's inside
- CI/CD status & workflows
- Environments and domains
- Security posture (headers, secrets, honeypot)
- Getting started locally

## CI/CD
- GitHub Actions → Vercel deploys (preview & prod)
- Vitest + coverage; PR must pass tests

## Security
- **No secrets committed** (use `.env.local`, Vercel env)
- **Honeypot** field on forms to block bots
- **Strict headers:** CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **Dev-only warning:** `allowedDevOrigins` is used locally to quiet LAN warnings
